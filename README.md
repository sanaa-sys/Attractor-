# Attractor

The goal of the software is to simulate an attractor motion. I did this as a part of a coding challenge. I used React to show an attractor simulation using sin(t) and cos(t) at time intervals from 0 to 1 using react-vis library. I also added a recorded feature which can record the simulation at a certain time interval.
